This is a directory that contains the code and data associated
with a GT-focused surveillance testing manuscript (Gibson, Weitz, et al.)
including code-bases and associated data

* Rolling averages of asymptomatic case positivity - R

* Estimates of the corresponding prevalence in Fulton County
using ascertainment biases consistent with Chande et al., 2020 
and CDC estimates - R

* SEIR scenario analysis meant to inform the choice to use
large-scale surveillance as a form of mitigation -- MATLAB

* Estimating the detection likelihood of outbreaks using partial testing
(leveraging the hypergeometric distribution) -- MATLAB

* Helper files for MATLAB printing available.
